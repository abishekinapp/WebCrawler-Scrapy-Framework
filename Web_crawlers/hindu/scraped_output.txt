And yet, as hard as I tried to force myself to pay attention to them, I was continually distracted by the dozens of employees sitting across from me, each dressed in head-to-toe Comme des Garçons — a band of ideologues in wait. Most had bangs and wore no jewelry. There were ruffled jackets made of washed wool, Arcimboldo-printed gowns accessorized with allergy masks. The skirts were long and layered, the ankle socks plentiful, the shoes flat, the Peter Pan collars oversize. They mixed seasons and lines (there are 18 under the Comme des Garçons label) to dizzying effect; some men wore women’s clothes, some women wore men’s clothes. It was like being in the middle of “", ",” the Rei Kawakubo retrospective mounted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year — but more urgent and immersive, as though the archive of her work had come to life.", "When I asked a devoted, elfin publicist in sequined basketball shorts the color of aquarium gravel if his colleagues had dressed up especially for the show, he looked at me with confusion, barely contained derision and maybe a bit of pity. “No,” he said. “We look like this always.”", "EVEN THE MOST oddly dressed woman is seldom doing anything all that transgressive with her appearance. We assume that women care about how they look, even when they don’t want to look pretty, so when they don kooky hats or outsize suits or shave their heads or apply rouge with purposefully grotesque abandon, it’s taken to be merely an outlandish variation on expected behavior. Meanwhile, an eccentrically dressed man — not a dandy in the Beau Brummell mold but someone plainly interested in creating new and jarring shapes with his body and clothes — is a rare and electrifying sight. In refusing to telegraph the traditional goals of male fashion (power, utility, wealth), it can seem as though he has renounced capitalism itself — even if the price of doing so is equal to a series of consecutive mortgage payments.", "Kawakubo introduced men’s wear in 1978, nearly a decade after she launched Comme des Garçons. It was instantly popular, thanks in part to a booming Japanese economy that, as W. David Marx notes in his 2015 book “", ",” put credit cards in the pockets of middle-class teenagers and made it possible for them to afford Comme des Garçons and similarly expensive, off-kilter clothing.", "The house’s earliest men’s suits were ill-fitting and dark, resembling something secondhand, an aesthetic once shunned by the fashion elite. The totems of the line are still rooted in almost-classic suiting and shirting, but never without a discreet signifier of willful rebellion: a pinstripe button-down’s sleeve’s hidden slashes, a pair of navy wool schoolboy shorts piped with leopard print; pleated black pants at once inflated, cropped and tapered. Years before the art school-y New York fashion label ", " sent painters, pregnant models and performance artists down their runways, Kawakubo cast the likes of ", " (1987), Francesco Clemente (1989), John Malkovich (1990), Dennis Hopper (1991) and Matt Dillon (1991) for her men’s shows. Robert Rauschenberg walked down the runway in 1993 completely drunk. Passionate and famous male fans of the brand include John Waters, who at the age of 46 modeled for Comme des Garçons in Paris in 1992; the writer ", ", who has admitted to compulsively buying the brand’s clownish culottes; and ", ", who named a song after the company. Also: Jared Leto, James Harden, ", " and Kanye West. “I like to describe Comme des Garçons as ‘how clothes,’ not ‘why clothes,’ ” Ken Utaka, a 48-year-old, New York-based freelance patternmaker, told me. Originally from Japan, Utaka has been wearing the brand since he was 15. “The question is not ", " they did something in this strange way but ", " they did it.”", "When I met Kawakubo, this is what I wanted to talk to her about: her approach to making clothing for men, whether or not she had thoughts about the state of masculinity in 2018, how designing men’s wear is different (or similar) to creating women’s wear. I wondered if perhaps the tighter constraints of masculine dress codes allowed, in fact, for more creativity and fun. I didn’t expect real answers. Kawakubo is notorious for her gnomic pronouncements (e.g., “The void is important”) and her anachronistic, otherworldly embodiment of what it means to be a genius. Once, in response to a journalist’s question, Kawakubo drew a circle on a piece of paper and walked away.", "To my surprise, I did not find the designer particularly aloof or monastic in her bearing. Flanked by her husband and translator, Adrian Joffe, who is also the company’s president, Kawakubo projected a kind of plain and quiet professionalism, though the topic of masculine versus feminine wares appeared to agitate her. “Men seem to have more courage to try new things now, not only in Japan but all over the world,” she said, wondering aloud why women have become “so quiet,” and why, these days, it’s the men who buy and wear the showpieces. Women, comparatively, have become more conservative. “It’s a bit upsetting,” she said. “If you have an insight into that, it might help with my business.”", "Kawakubo recalled how when she was younger, in the 1980s especially, young women added their names to lists for expensive pieces and were happy to wait in long lines to buy them. These days, though, “There’s a tendency for men to queue up to buy things,” she said. “I wonder why women don’t do this. Why are there no women queuing up for Supreme or Nike?” I suggested that perhaps in an age of digital streaming, streetwear had replaced record collecting, sublimating whatever obsessive, completist, seemingly male-specific tendencies that were once reserved for rare Nirvana EPs and Kanye’s earliest mixtapes. Kawakubo seemed to have no reaction to this theory, and said nothing.", "It’s true that while there are certainly women who consider themselves dedicated fans of Comme des Garçons (in the early days, they were known in Tokyo as “the crows,” since Kawakubo and her followers were so devoted to the color black), the company seems to hold an even more special place in the hearts of men. “It’s the most addictive brand I’ve ever come into contact with,” said Lane Spodek, a 28-year-old sales associate at the downtown New York City branch of the high-fashion mini-emporium ", ".", "Like many men I spoke to, Spodek told me that wearing Comme des Garçons gives him the impression of having turned himself into a work of art. He spends almost all of his discretionary income on Comme des Garçons and is saving up for a trip to Japan, which he referred to as a “pilgrimage.”", "Though Kawakubo described Comme des Garçons’ male clientele as comprising students and men with creative jobs — “Anyone who is not free in his work probably is not wearing our clothes”— she admitted that the so-called rules of men’s wear (subdued colors, suiting materials, professional silhouettes) make designing for men more interesting, especially as someone with a self-imposed edict to always be creating new, never-before-seen garments. “The basics of clothing lie in men’s fashion,” she has said.", "“The best thing about Comme des Garçons clothes is how they fit. As weird as they might look, they actually feel really natural on the body and are designed very practically,” said Utaka. I asked him if he had a favorite item. “A ridiculously cool black coat from the fall 2012 collection,” he answered. “It looks like anybody could have made it, like it’s just two pieces of fabric stuck together.” Part of Kawakubo’s 2D collection (every Comme des Garçons collection is named, and the clothes hew literally to the theme, though Kawakubo’s interpretation of “literal” can often feel like abstraction), the piece is a visual paradox, at once completely flat-looking and voluminous, with rounded shoulders, a nipped waist and angular hips — like what you’d make if asked to design a parka for a paper doll. Utaka praised the garment’s draping and lapel construction, noting that although the coat’s structure looks simple, its engineering is anything but.", "This secret pragmatism is perhaps the most traditionally masculine feature of Kawakubo’s designs for men. Those who wear Comme des Garçons tend to talk about how the clothes don’t feel new, even when they are — you try on a jacket with the tags still attached and have the impression that it’s been hanging in your closet for years. Kevin Hearn, a 49-year-old musician and keyboardist for the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies and longtime Comme des Garçons client, says Kawakubo’s garments “feel musical — like each item is a different song, something that brings color and joy and inventiveness into the world.” When we spoke, Hearn was wearing his latest purchase — a black Gore-Tex slicker with a grim reaperlike hood. He described Comme des Garçons clothes as “playful” and then said, “but this raincoat isn’t funny at all. It’s elegant and well designed. It has pockets where you want there to be pockets, strings where you want there to be strings.” Kawakubo, he noted, “isn’t joking around.”", "The male ardor for Comme des Garçons is, at least in part, a kind of gratitude for a gender-fluid approach to fashion design that has gone mainstream in recent years but was practiced by Kawakubo, virtually alone, for decades. She shrank suit jackets to Chanel topper proportions, made handsome (no other word for it) skirts out of gabardine and tacked schoolgirl collars on otherwise office-ready white button-downs. She gave men a way of opting out of society while still remaining in it. For nearly a century, there had been little to no innovation in men’s wear — a steady, conservative beat of sensible, timeless clothing. Then suddenly, Kawakubo appeared like a sorceress, materializing a new and more permissive way of appearing in the world that changed not only fashion but, on a small scale, maleness itself. Now, 40 years after she began designing men’s wear, her philosophical heirs — ", ", ", ", ", ", to name a few — are everywhere. This, finally, is their time.", "“WHAT DID YOUR father dress like?” I asked Kawakubo about halfway through our interview. Joffe translated, and Kawakubo spoke to him in Japanese for what felt like 20 to 30 seconds. “She doesn’t understand the question,” Joffe said. He laughed, Kawakubo did not, and it was tacitly understood that this was tantamount to a refusal.", "The conversation continued a bit awkwardly. Kawakubo expressed annoyance that her spring 2017 collection (Naked King) hadn’t gotten the credit it deserved for popularizing transparent garments for men — a trend seen on the runways (Calvin Klein, Balenciaga, Off-White) for seasons after. She explained that incorporating unexpected materials, like the ghostly knit PVC she employed in that collection, is the challenge and joy of designing for men. “The one thing she doesn’t like is camping clothing — you know, walking-outdoors fashion?” Joffe interjected. “", ", you mean?” I asked. He nodded and scribbled the word down in English on a scrap of paper for Kawakubo to read. “You know this word?” he asked. She shook her head in disdain. “The most boring fashion for her is this,” he said. “I have looked to see if there is anything interesting here and I have not found it,” Kawakubo added.", "Kawakubo likes to insist that first and foremost, she is a businesswoman. This is true in a certain sense ($300 million in yearly sales for the labels combined, and 135 stores, all of which Kawakubo owns completely), but also almost hilariously imprecise. “Most businesses only think of evolution and growth in terms of the bottom line, and maybe the difference with Comme des Garçons is that it’s not necessarily what you can and can’t sell that makes the business, because the business is creation,” she said. Kawakubo admits that her venture into men’s wear was a practical decision, not an artistic one. But, she added, “I’ve often thought this is the most difficult way to do business. It’s not easy to sell only ideas and ones that people are not used to.” Every choice she makes, she said, even about corporate structuring, “is based on aesthetic values.”", "Whether she likes it or not — and it’s almost certain that she does — the products of Kawakubo’s business are, for the most part, bought and enjoyed as art. And to see someone in Comme des Garçons on the street is to wonder if perhaps fashion isn’t actually more generous, more civic-minded, more political than art. Unlike a painting purchased in a gallery and hung on the wall of a private home, a Comme des Garçons garment actually circulates in the world, confronting (and delighting and confusing and frustrating) the very people who never would or could wear it themselves.", "That’s how I felt, at least, that morning in Tokyo. Sitting across the office runway from all those Comme des Garçons employees, I was in awe — and ashamed. My outfit, which I had chosen to be both appropriate and flattering, suddenly looked not just boring but selfish. It delighted neither me nor anyone else. It seemed like a waste. I had dressed, I realized, like a man might — a non-Comme des Garçons-wearing man.", "A few days later, when I returned to the office to interview Kawakubo, I wore different — but similarly lackluster — clothes. I had no delusions that she even took note of my appearance, though I was also certain that if she did, it would have depressed her. “Is there any man you wish you could design for and haven’t?” I asked at the end of our hourlong meeting. Kawakubo shook her head. “It’s a stupid question,” she said."], "publish_date": "2018-09-03T09:00:07.000Z", "created_date": "2018-09-03T10:16:12.115Z", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/t-magazine/rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons-menswear.html"},{"subtitle": "Our columnist books a session with a makeup artist.

", "She didn’t bother with makeup on the dark circles under my eyes. “Everything settles into the skin so you’re better off using an illuminating eye cream,” she said, and grabbed a small bottle of Amanda Lacey Illuminating Eye Gel, which has an opalescent tone. She patted it under my eyes. ", "“I don’t ever want to be contoured,” I said with a lot of conviction as she moved on to my cheeks. We started with a very light Victoria Beckham bronzer I bought a few months ago after seeing a similarly pale friend raving about it online. The trouble was that I didn’t really know where to put it. ", "“We’ll use it as a blush, applying it directly on the cheekbone and sweeping out at the temple,” Ms. Kaiser said. She demonstrated one cheek, and I managed the other. She blended some Kosas illuminating cream that I already owned in a C shape around the eye and temple and blended it down to meet the blush as a low-key highlighter. ", "“The goal is for you not to be able to tell where one begins and the other ends,” she said. Finally we brushed on Glossier Boy Brow in Blonde to tame my curly eyebrows and swept Kosas Rosewater on my lips.", "I studied the results in a hand mirror.

I looked like Meghan Markle on her wedding day, minus probably a pound of makeup and a redheaded prince.

For lips, she chose Kosas Electra, an emphatic blue-red, and used a lip brush to carefully apply it. Even though I do have a lip brush somewhere, not using one turned out to be my problem with the Fenty Beauty lip paint.

These days, his public identity — which combines the reticence of a downbeat bodhisattva with a penchant for glowering — occupies more of the collective imagination than his oeuvre does, or perhaps it’s just that his persona and his characters have become inextricable: The concepts for both “Ode to Happiness” and “Shadows” feel borne out of an indelible 2010 meme of Sad Keanu, photographed on a New York City park bench ", ".", "That latter book, which was also presented as a series of gallery exhibitions, first at the erstwhile Acme gallery in Los Angeles and last year as part of ", " in Paris, prompted Grant and Reeves to consider the experimental capabilities of book publishing. “Part of the genesis of X Artists’ Books was that these projects might become a performance or an exhibition,” Grant says.

Encouraged by Taylor, Sohn eventually agreed to co-host a larger event, at Taylor’s home, and party planning followed. “I wanted my house for the setting in the hopes that it would make everyone feel cozy and welcome,” explains Taylor, Sohn’s co-host and close friend.", "Just before sunset on the warm summer night, guests began to gather outside Taylor’s home and cool off in the shade of the garden’s giant sycamore trees. Against the woodsy backdrop, a single clothing rack showcased Sohn’s streamlined collection, but many of the pieces could also be seen in the crowd: Vivier arrived wearing a pink button-down of Sohn’s design, while the artist Mindy Shapero, the jewelry designer Grace Lee and the textile consultant Joanna Williams all had on the same billowy-sleeved shirt dress from the collection in eggplant, cream and caramel-hued velvet, respectively. Taylor wore the line’s V-neck Flower dress, which Sohn had made especially for her in cornflower blue. “Everyone wants to dress like Jeana,” says Taylor, “And now we all have a chance to.” Here, Sohn shares her fundamentals for entertaining", "with style and ease.", "“It’s O.K. if the dishes and glasses are different,” says Sohn. “I don’t try to make things too perfect.” To ready her home for the evening, Taylor chose a wide range of tablecloths, napkins and pillows of her own design in a mix of blue stripes and honey-colored hues to play off Sohn’s mostly neutral palette.", "“I was tempted to use bold prints to attract more attention to my collection, but I reminded myself that’s not what my line was about,” says Sohn of her minimalist tailored pieces.

To complement the evening’s late summer theme, the floral designer Kristen Caissie, of the studio Moon Canyon, filled short vases with billowy white garden roses, sunset-hued Garden Show dahlias and wild grasses. Edible blooms also found their way into the food. Stern, who is best known for her pressed-flower shortbread cookies, incorporated chamomile buds into bountiful grazing boards of truffle cheese and fresh figs, sprinkled blue bachelor’s buttons onto stone fruit-topped bruschetta, and baked homegrown herbs and petals into crackers.", "The drinks table was well stocked with a selection of chilled wines from Sohn and Taylor’s go-to wine shop, Helen’s Wines in West Hollywood: They chose Piedmontese La Mesma Gavi white wine, as well as Rosabella Rosato and Dolcetto d’Alba by the label GD Vajra, also from northwestern Italy.

Surrounding it are more recently constructed low-rise apartments, as if the area had been rebuilt in the wake of a bomb. There’s a bucolic park. The atmosphere would seem suburban except that, outside the house, the street is lightly charred: Someone set the garbage bins on fire the night before.", "The person who opens the door is so quiet that he offers almost an anti-greeting. Although I slightly recognize him from photographs, I half wonder if the furniture designer ", " is actually somewhere inside, and this is a friend of his, ready to lead me to him. He is wearing a white T-shirt stained with paint and navy cutoff sweat shorts. His feet are bare, his eyes a sharp green, his slept-in hair of such volume that you think it might be, like one of ", ", first engineered, then deconstructed. “So, this is the house,” he says with a shrug, once we reach the forest green living room. A child is squealing merrily outside. He adds shyly, “That’s my son.” I don’t see anyone else here, but I still find myself asking, “Are you Guillermo?”", "He is. Santomà introduces me to Jan, the 2-year-old splashing in the small outdoor pool. With Jan is his mother, ", ", a 38-year-old graphic designer who has lived here with Santomà, 32, since the day he moved in three years ago, after buying the house the year before.", "Back inside, I’m given a tour, during which I realize that the building is not one story but three. The only original element (dating back to the early 1900s) is the cramped entrance hall at its core, from which the other six rooms break. The front spaces are narrow and small-windowed, so Santomà’s mission was to introduce as much light as possible into the 1,722-square-foot house. He also wanted a sense of continuity, which he achieved by dramatically extending some of the original colors throughout the house. The dining room and kitchen are Pepto-Bismol pink — not so much covered in it as made of it: Santomà points out that even the electrical sockets and light switches are painted. “I think of color as a material, an additional object within the space,” he says. “It’s modified by the light, which is both separate from it and part of it.”", "On one wall of the ground-floor dining room, his artist friend ", " has added large-scale doodles in dripping black and white: Pieces of fruit, a flying carpet, a palm tree and a Greek pillar all float in the space like free associations, then find themselves reflected in the room itself, where there’s also a (real) fruit bowl on the table, a carpet and a palm tree. The drips find echoes in the dining chairs, which Santomà designed: plastic garden seats melted so that their backs are partly missing, frozen mid-ooze, then thickly painted in the same intense pink. They are mutant chairs, each one different — finished pieces that appear to be morphing. “That’s the basis of my work,” Santomà says. “That it grows, that it connects, that it gets mixed up — you don’t quite know where one thing ends and another begins.” His work aligns with a zany cohort of contemporary designers-cum-artists that includes the Brooklyn furniture makers ", " and ", ". You can live with his designs, Santomà says, but they might be more accurately considered installations.", "SANTOMÀ USED AN INHERITANCE from his grandmother to buy Casa Horta for 190,000 euros — about a third of what it would cost today. He grew up in Barcelona, and he was familiar with the Horta-Guinardó district (for which his property is named) because he used to walk dogs in its namesake, Parc del Guinardó, which offers panoramic views of the city. The house itself, while humble and precariously constructed, seemed to him related to ", " a grand, early 20th-century Modernista building just several blocks away that was designed by the Spanish architect ", ". Its old entrance hall is full of pink marble pillars; if you go there, you may struggle to see the connection, but to Santomà the association was obvious: The opening room of his own house would be pink.", "The first night he spent at Casa Horta, he attended a gallery opening, where he saw Quevedo. They went their separate ways, then bumped into each other at a club later that night before ending up back in his home. “Wow,” she said when she walked in. “It looks like a squat. I’m sure I’ve been here for a rave.”", "Though Santomà is an architect by training and has worked at well-known Spanish firms including Pich and ", ", his house’s renovations were done after a long stay in the remote ", " and, in that anti-bourgeois frame of mind, entirely improvised. “In place of an architectural plan, we had a team of five guys who had only very basic notions of construction,” he says. What they mainly did was tear down walls to open up rooms, inventively gouging the original mass. The staircase, for instance, has evolved into a new one with a hole in the living room wall that once enclosed it, which allows light to fall through to the downstairs space from three floors above; from the vantage point of the living room’s built-in couch, it resembles a light installation. There is no barrier or railing, and when I worry, reflexively, about Jan falling through the opening, Santomà laughs and says the little boy is accustomed to the house, and that he’d only land on the soft green sofas below anyway.", "Casa Horta’s geometric oddities reverberate throughout. As you ascend the stairs, the walls and ceilings blend into overlapping curves. The entire ground-floor garden is a jungle — an unruly confusion — that leads to a swimming pool no larger than four average-size bathtubs, built out from the back wall. The structure’s strange configuration makes it appear more sculptural than architectural, and so, too, does Santomà’s vast and eclectic collection of iconic European design objects from the last century: a giant foam foot in the hallway by the Italian artist ", ", along with one of his butterfly-like Nobody’s Perfect chairs in the office, which sits near a wiry Parentesi floor lamp by the Italian designers Achille Castiglioni and Pio Manzù. The juxtapositions of these pieces make the place feel at once deliberate and disobedient.", "Because most homes in Barcelona are apartments, Santomà wanted to preserve Casa Horta’s identity as a house by maintaining its verticality. The ground floor’s pink mosaic shower, near the kitchen, is a double-height, 23-foot column without a ceiling. It’s an unnerving cross between a cylinder, a prism and a cell: Anyone walking past the shower area on the floor above — emerging from the staircase, for instance — can spy on whoever’s bathing within it. Likewise, the ceiling above the ground-floor living room is not quite a ceiling but an open metal grid, painted in the same deep green as the walls; the caging forms the floor of Santomà’s second-floor guest quarters, with a mattress on the ground that seems to hover in space. On the next story is the couple’s bedroom — again, a mattress surrounded by light — and a roof terrace, which is all white, spartan, hot and void of greenery, with a view of the street below.", "THE LAYOUT OF THE HOUSE, with each area opening up from the one adjacent to it, is inherently knit together and choppy, almost porous, so the boundaries remain relaxed. Apart from one large room in the basement, where they watch TV and grill, the only separate space is Jan’s bedroom, opposite the dining room on the ground floor. It’s painted an embracingly deep blue, with a twin bed transformed by Santomà to be an alien structure. Red foam spits out of the bed’s sides and explodes into a gigantic lamp culminating in a huge, illuminated red rubber ball, which contrasts wildly against the house’s century-old tile mosaic flooring. On the walls are aphoristic posters by Quevado in primary colors (“Money makes me ugly”; “Mickey makes me happy”). It’s less a domestic bedroom than an immersive environment, each element providing a gentle landing: friendly but extraterrestrial.", "The design of the house makes sense when you consider Santomà’s personal aesthetic. His last name means “hand of a saint” in Catalan; he has used the phrase ", " in the titles of his pieces. The notion of disrupting something to make it new is particularly appealing to him. “I’m less interested in destruction,” he says, “than in the material transformation of objects.” Although he makes things by hand, he considers himself less a craftsman than a performer.", "Last year, in Santomà’s studio in nearby Cornellà de Llobregat, around 300 people came to watch him make a table, a lamp and a chair out of polystyrene. Aided by volunteers, he spray-painted the resin blocks to render them more flammable, then set them ablaze with a blowtorch. Having hollowed the pieces out, he then connected them with fire, filled them with wet plaster and waited for that to dry, then dramatically set fire to the furniture again, leaving bits of them black and dripping, like ash-covered stalactites. “I always tell the people in my studio that it’s 98 percent thinking and 2 percent making,” he says.", "The house follows that logic, too. Santomà speaks of it as something that was grown rather than designed. And it ", " a think piece itself — a piece of finished thought. Part of that thought is a social experiment: not to create an interior, per se, but a reaction to space and light. “It’s very hard for architecture to be neutral,” Santomà says. “People attempt it all the time, but architecture is an impetus; it forces you to behave in a certain way.” Recently, he adds, Casa Horta has begun to feel finished. There are no rooms left to expose, few remaining spots to place new objects. So he’s looking for somewhere else — somewhere he can start dismantling anew."], "publish_date": "2018-08-27T09:00:21.000Z", "created_date": "2018-08-31T18:33:00.487Z", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/t-magazine/architect-guillermo-santoma-casa-horta-barcelona.html"},{"subtitle": "A cast of creative people, including a magazine editor and a chef, share their favorite places to eat, drink, shop and play.", "title": "What to Do in Berlin, According to 6 Locals - The New York Times", "image_details": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/03/t-magazine/travel/3tmag-berlin-slide-YDQ2/3tmag-berlin-slide-YDQ2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "content": ["Berlin has long been the world capital of the underground.

Moving beyond the fear and guilt that dominates the climate conversation, we wanted — as our name implies — to cultivate a sense of affection for the climate, and to recognize its ancient and complex relationship to human cultures. Our goal was to nudge aside the modern habit of thinking of nature and culture as opposites, which leads us to forget that we are earthlings, one species among many that share this planet. Dear Climate dwells on the deep entanglements of our species with not only animals, but also plants, minerals, organic matter and the bio-geo-physical systems (including climate) that govern the Earth. Highlighting this aspect of human life could help to mend the broken connections, or restore the lost understandings, that have put us on a collision course with our own home planet. This poster is meant to encourage viewers to consider the following questions: Can you give up some of your separateness? Can you take other forms and merge with other beings? Can you have less distinct edges? Can you embrace your inherent porousness as an earthly organism? ", "“Arctic Ocean” is a pastel drawing on paper that depicts an aerial view of summer sea ice off the northwest coast of Ellesmere Island, Canada. The inspiration for the piece came from several flights I took with IceBridge, a NASA operation that has been mapping the ice at both poles for over a decade. The data that IceBridge collects provides crucial information on how our polar regions are responding to climate change, helping scientists to predict the effects ice melt will have on rising sea levels and the global climate system. ", "My work, including “Arctic Ocean,” aims to illuminate this data through a medium that can move us in a way that statistics cannot. The remote regions I draw are the keystones of climate change but are inaccessible to most people. I draw as much precise detail as I can in order to transport the viewer to a place that is otherwise distant and abstract. I convey the beauty of these vulnerable landscapes, as opposed to their devastation, to inspire viewers to help protect and preserve them.", "I am curious about the ways that landscape contributes to social, political and psychic ideas of space, particularly within the rural American South. I consider landscape’s role in Americana and how the natural environment functions in the drama of American life. In my treatment of land, the natural environment is the central protagonist in the unfolding history of this nation and our contemporary culture. My approach to climate change focuses on how the increasing vulnerability of the environment is directly related to that of certain communities that live within it, on how climate-related natural disasters illuminate existing social and political inequality.", "I’ve been exploring these ideas primarily in my home regions — I was born in Kentucky, raised in Florida and my maternal family’s farm and homestead lies in the rural flatlands of western Tennessee. I made “Brecencia and Pheasant III” in North Florida, as part of an ongoing collection of works seeking to animate the land as a guide and witness by staging a series of environmental portraits. These photographs and videos feature a cast of mythical characters based on family stories and folk tales from the region. Each character responds to the changing environment in distinct ways — from curiosity, to grief, to rage.", "“The Intermediaries” are half-spectral things and warnings for the indifferent.

A recent order by President Donald J. Trump shrank the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument by nearly 700,000 acres, and it seems likely that more mining will come to the area. The text on the pine box is from Samuel Beckett’s 1953 novel The Unnamable. “It is because there is nothing. It is because I have no Eyes.” Here, in this context, the excerpt prompts us to ask: What do people see when they experience this land, and what is hidden? The objects in the photograph — clays used for pigments, tools containing uranium, copper used in bullets — were found in the area, and expose its contradictions: Extraction and smelting processes toxify the land and its dependents, while the extracted elements are simultaneously necessary to create the goods that sustain many ways of life.

We can use our unique skill sets to heal communities, tackle complex challenges and even create innovative answers. For me, comprehending the science is the first step in defining a project. Understanding the impacts, predictions, remediation and adaptation help to ground the work in reality. ", "Much of my work is focused on the waterways that surround us. This image is based on the research I have undertaken to better understand New York City’s urban waterways. This research includes the mapping of these waterways now and at the end of this century, when scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect sea levels to have risen by about six feet. I have also been mapping myriad aspects of the waterways, including how they intersect and influence one another, and I have been getting to know professionals shaping the future of the water, as well as people who use the city’s waterways recreationally and who understand them through decades of experience and intimate observation. Through all of this, I aim to ignite radical ideas for the future of the waterways in light of the climate chaos we are already witnessing.", "Making artwork about climate change is inextricably tied to the history of human intervention in lands and waterways. In the Southeast, where I live, that means contending with the history of colonization, war, the slave trade and mass industrialization as a backdrop to the onslaught of droughts, super storms and rising tides of the ecological future. I’ve been traveling to barrier islands from the Mid-Atlantic down and around to the Gulf of Mexico, because these sites are not only rapidly changing from the acceleration of climate change and rising sea levels but also bear the marks of the violent history of America. ", "I wanted to document this sculpture on Daufuskie Island in South Carolina, which was originally a home to indigenous Muscogee peoples before being invaded by Europeans. The island then became part of the slave plantation economy until the Civil War. Following the War, freed slaves turned the island into their home, and the Gullah Geechee identity and culture that developed throughout the Lowcountry region thrived there for decades until wealthy white vacationers began to reclaim the island as their personal playground around the 1980s. I traveled with this piece from Atlanta in a ferry down the Intracoastal Waterway and then in a rickety golf cart to the island’s public beach. I washed her in the hot salty waves and then I stripped down to my underwear and flung myself into the ocean too. The water was so warm, almost bathlike, and I floated and bobbed along the shore, the McMansions behind me partially obscured by trees covered in Spanish moss, and in front of me, a horizon dotted only by a handful of tankers pulling cargo into port. My barrier island works are markers, clocks, fragile emblems, souvenirs of places that exist in conflict with their past and in defiance of their future.", "I first heard the words “climate change” in 1994 when I asked a paleontologist friend “What are you afraid of for our future?” He mentioned climate change and told me why he was scared. I was terrified but hopeful that we could rally as a species and avoid disaster. A lot has changed since then — mainly, from an environmental perspective — for the worse. I used to hope that knowledge and information would open our eyes to environmental devastation and that we would save the world. ", "I made art partly to cope with what I was witnessing and to support a campaign for conservation. I believed that if one could render moments of extinction, genocide, population explosion and political discord visible, then we might learn to confront and change the conditions leading to civilization’s collapse. Over the past two decades, I realized we have a crucial Achilles heel: Our brains are wired to be tribal and to think only in the seasonal short term. Even someone as persuasive as Al Gore could not successfully galvanize the world with his books and films. The idea of “sacrificing” for the future seems ridiculous to most people when they are entrenched in a daily struggle for survival. Even if they will listen, people just don’t have the collective will to do much. The engine of capitalism is too powerful.

The area deteriorated in the mid-20th century, as landlords turned once-grand apartment buildings into single-room occupancy hotels. Crime became a problem. When Rosemary MacMillan moved into a three-bedroom co-op in the West 100s from a one-bedroom rental near Broadway in the 1970s, she said, she would never venture past the park’s low stone walls. A playground on the perimeter, at West 110th Street, a favorite of her daughter’s, was about as far as she got.

Today, three-bedrooms in her building go for more than $2 million, according to sales records.", "“The buildings are more remarkable over here than on Central Park West,” Ms. MacMillan said, with a lighthearted jab at a rival.

Sometimes wide, with two-lane traffic, the drive splits into tangles of smaller streets of the same name, some of which are as narrow as country lanes, as at West 97th Street.", "Those splits create fragments of greenery — parks within parks, or “islands,” according to signs on some blocks, including West 94th Street, where a statue of Joan of Arc, on horseback with a sword, is an island highlight.

Frederick Law Olmsted, the Central Park creator who disliked sharp corners, laid out much of the street and park in the late 19th century.

In Chicago, where I specialize in surgical oncology, I see one patient at a time. In Aleppo, I see 20 at once. You live your life one massacre to the next: of children at school, or of families sleeping at home or shopping at a market. We hear the jets screech by, the helicopters whirring in the sky, the mortars launching, then the bombs exploding. Followed by sirens and screaming.", "The screaming seems never to end, some days. So many people pushing through the entrance. There are never enough beds, so patients have to share gurneys or lie on the floor. Sometimes, there is no place to step, with patients lying on floors smeared with blood and strewn with body parts. There are few field hospitals left in Aleppo, so patients who are stuck outside and can’t make it in sometimes die on our doorstep.", "Then, abruptly, it ends. I walk away from all those patients. I am driven through sniper alleys, under airstrikes, and past checkpoints to cross the border into Turkey. From there, I fly home.", "It crushes me every time. One moment, I’m in an underground hospital shaking from the blasts of missiles, saving whom we can, watching those we can’t bleed to death. The next moment, I am at the airport coffee shop watching a man in a sharp suit cut the line or a woman berate the barista for putting too much ice in her tea.", "Nothing makes sense, and you feel like a ghost. Once you’ve been there, you never really leave Aleppo.", "Back in Chicago, it’s my patients who help me stay focused. I had a patient I’ll call Sarah who had a sarcoma of the leg when she was 8. She endured a year of chemotherapy and had a portion of her fibula removed to excise the cancer, followed by radiation. The treatment stunted her leg’s growth and deformed her ankle, but she wanted to be able to run track and play soccer.", "On a ski trip to Colorado, she saw people skiing on prosthetics, and that’s what she wanted. When she turned 11, she looked me in the eye and asked me to amputate her left leg. She showed such strength. She reminded me of Ahmad, a Syrian boy who had lost both legs, as well as his mother, when a bomb destroyed their home. He hoped one day to get robotic prostheses so he could walk again. His resilience was inspiring.", "Each time I go back to Aleppo, though, conditions are worse. The pockets of life have become more tenuous with each visit. The markets, the children in the streets, the bustle of day-to-day living is replaced with rubble: apocalyptic wastelands of gutted buildings with collapsed roofs, exposed rebar and twisted staircases.", "But people still live amid the ruins. You see them hanging laundry from a room on the third floor of a building cut in half. You see kids climbing over a 10-foot mound of rubble on their way home with some bread and water. Life has to go on, and people find ways to cope. They would rather face death at home than suffer in a refugee camp or risk drowning in a sinking boat.", "For a surgeon in this setting, triage decisions mean the difference between life and death. A mother pleads with me to attend to her son; his skull is blown open, his brain exposed. He’s gone. There’s nothing we can do.", "I move on to a girl with a lacerated artery in her amputated leg. She could bleed to death in minutes, but with pressure and a tourniquet we buy some time. Next to her is another young girl. Her right hand is obliterated: frayed tendons, twisted fingers, crushed bones. Her mother grips my shoulder, begging me to take her daughter to surgery first. But the girl is alive and she can wait.", "This can last for hours. I lose all track of time. Eventually, the chaos dissipates. The floors are mopped clean. The dead are wrapped in white shrouds and laid in the street to make room for the next incoming tide of the wounded and dying.", "You feel powerless. You can’t stop it. There aren’t enough hands to help, and you can’t save everyone. Should we give all of our blood supplies to save one life? Or ration them to save five who all need some? The choices are impossible, yet we make them.", "The Syrian medics and rescue workers in Aleppo have sacrificed everything, some even their lives. They show up to work every day despite all the horrifying brutality. Those of us who go to volunteer cannot stop the bombs, but we can serve in solidarity with Syria’s full-time lifesavers. Who would I be if I could not support them and follow their lead for a few weeks a year?", "They are among the most heroic, courageous and selfless people I have ever met — much like the New York firefighters I met on Sept. 11, 2001. A medical student at the time, I squeezed into an ambulance with nurses and medics and we drove toward the smoke and ashes to help. I saw firefighters, paramedics, police officers and citizens rushing to the World Trade Center. That was the side I wanted to be on.", "We wrote our names on the back of our scrubs with black markers in case our bodies needed to be identified. I was scared, but I was surrounded by good people doing the right thing.", "I had never felt that way again until I went back to Aleppo in August 2013. I had visited Syria several times growing up, and knew Aleppo, but that was my first trip since the conflict started. The overwhelming sadness and dread I felt on Sept. 11, I feel every day in Aleppo.", "One night, we treated a child caught in an explosion who had the bone shards of obliterated bystanders embedded in his skin. An airstrike hit his school during a charity event to donate clothes to the poor. The last thing he remembered was seeing his best friend disintegrate in front of him.", "The boy’s father saw me and asked who I was, and why I was speaking in a strange language. A nurse explained to him that I was an American doctor. He told me that he had never met an American. He never thought he would. He never believed the day would come when an American doctor — one with Syrian blood but born and raised with the freedoms and luxuries of the United States — would come to Aleppo to help in a time of war.", "That gave my work a new dimension of meaning: a palpable connection to alleviate the suffering of a people long abandoned. It lets them know that they’re not alone. It has made me only more grateful for my life in America. It’s also why I go back."], "publish_date": "2016-08-26T17:16:27.000Z", "created_date": "2018-01-20T01:19:00.294Z", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/opinion/sunday/why-i-go-to-aleppo.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"},{"subtitle": "President Vladimir V.

Putin was on national television here, brashly declaring Russia’s historical claims over Ukrainian territory, reiterating a threat to use military force and generally sounding a defiant, even mocking, tone toward the United States. ", "Mr. Putin, appearing cool and confident during a four-hour question-and-answer show, referred repeatedly to southeast Ukraine as “New Russia” — a historical term for the area north of the Black Sea that the Russian Empire conquered in the 1700s. And, he said, only “God knows” why the region became part of Ukraine in the 1920s, signaling that he would gladly correct that error. ", "Dropping previous pretenses, he calmly acknowledged for the first time that Russian troops had been deployed to", ". And in perhaps the day’s most astonishing moment, he took evident delight in fielding a prerecorded question from ", ", the fugitive American who is wanted on espionage charges for leaking documents on surveillance programs. ", "If Mr. Putin’s show of bravado seemed out of sync with the diplomatic niceties in Geneva, it laid plain his determination to sustain Russian influence over Ukraine and his utter refusal to be cowed by the West. The tentative agreement did not address Russia’s annexation of Crimea, nor did it require the Kremlin to withdraw its troops massed on the Ukrainian border. ", "While Russia’s willingness to go along with the accord most likely forestalled an immediate new round of economic sanctions by the West, Mr. Putin’s televised remarks made clear that his view of an independent Ukraine as a historical accident had not changed, nor had the existing, narrowly targeted sanctions deterred his plan to reassert Russian power by challenging America’s dominance in global affairs. ", "Underscoring that his views on Ukraine are still driven by long-held beliefs, Mr. Putin on Thursday repeated his view that the West had lied to Russia about NATO expansion. “At one time we were promised,” Mr. Putin said, “that after Germany’s unification, NATO wouldn’t spread eastward.” ", "He continued: “Our decision on Crimea was partially prompted by this. Needless to say, first and foremost we wanted to support the residents of Crimea. But we also followed certain logic: if we don’t do anything, Ukraine will be drawn into NATO sometime in the future. We’ll be told, ‘This doesn’t concern you’ and NATO ships will dock in Sevastopol, the city of Russia’s naval glory.” ", "Mr. Putin’s view that the West has lied to Russia and humiliated him on numerous occasions, including its plans for Libya, explain why he will continue to talk — and act — tough on Ukraine even as he takes diplomatic steps toward resolving the crisis, said Samuel Charap, the senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the ", ", a research organization in Washington. ", "“They are going to keep the boots on Ukraine’s throat until they are 100 percent convinced that they have gotten what they wanted,” Mr. Charap said in an interview. “They believe that if they completely pulled back from the pressure they are applying, tomorrow the West would swoop in and try to steal Ukraine away again.” ", "Mr. Putin’s willingness to challenge the West aggressively also reflects his relatively strong position — militarily in post-Soviet space, and politically on the domestic front. “He’s at the top of his game,” Mr. Charap said. “In terms of the situation on the ground and Ukraine’s future, they have the upper hand.” He added, “There’s a sense you get watching him of someone who has an 80 percent approval rating and has been supported by the people he cares about most.” ", "That much was clear throughout Mr. Putin’s four-hour session. Although he sat at a desk throughout, he seemed to be strutting the entire time. ", "Mr. Putin pointedly asserted that he had the authority to invade Ukraine, but added that he hoped it would not be necessary.", "“I remind you that the Federation Council has given the president the right to use armed forces in Ukraine,” he said, referring to the upper house of Parliament. “I very much hope that I will not have to exercise this right, and that through political and diplomatic means we will be able to resolve all the pressing, if not to say burning, issues in Ukraine.” ", "Mr. Putin’s use of the historical term “Novorossiya,” or “New Russia,” to refer to southeastern Ukraine, which he had not emphasized previously, suggested that he was replicating Russia’s assertions of historical ties to the Crimean Peninsula before its occupation and annexation.", "Novorossiya generally refers to a broad area, stretching from what is now the border of Moldova in the west to the Russian border in the east, including Donetsk, the port city of Odessa to the south and the industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk to the north. On the question of Ukraine, Mr. Putin repeated his assertions that Russia feels an obligation to protect ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, where they are a large minority of the population. “We must do everything to help these people to protect their rights and independently determine their own destiny,” he said.", "“The question is to ensure the rights and interests of the Russian southeast,” he added. “It’s New Russia. Kharkiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, Odessa were not part of Ukraine in czarist times, they were transferred in 1920. Why? God knows. Then for various reasons these areas were gone, and the people stayed there. We need to encourage them to find a solution.”", "Mr. Putin took questions from the studio audience in Moscow, but also from various other locations, including Sevastopol in Crimea, where Russia maintains the headquarters of its Black Sea fleet and where the cameras showed a large, cheering crowd, with many people waving Russian flags.", "Mr. Putin was at his most determined in asserting Russia’s right to protect itself against Western threats. ", "“When the infrastructure of a military bloc approaches our borders, we have grounds for certain apprehensions and questions,” he said at one point. “We must take certain steps.” ", "At another point he said that Russia simply could not allow NATO into Ukraine.
